# Exploring US Bikeshare Data
This project was completed as part of the course requirements of Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) certification.

The default repo branch contains an updated version of the project utilizing Numpy and Pandas. The master branch of the repo contains the original project and code.

## Overview
The project used data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. The project examined usage patterns in three major US cities - Chicago, Washington and New York.

An interactive experience was created to allow users to select data for a specific city and filter the data by a specific month or day of the week.

The user was provided with information (both text and visuals) on metrics such as most common start day/time, average trip duration, most common start station, end station and trip, proportions of subscribers and casual users, and most popular birth year.

A walk-thru of the experience is found in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/rebeccaebarnes/DAND-Project-2/blob/Updated-project/bikeshare-code-walkthru.ipynb) and some brief findings are found at [my blog](https://rebeccaebarnes.github.io/2018/02/27/learning-python).

##Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib
- Excel
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Key Findings
- Use of the bikeshare program appears to correlate with improved weather
- Use patterns indicate that the most common use of the bikeshare program is commuting - most common start times align with commute start times
- Across all three cities the most popular days for use were Wednesdays and Tuesdays
- The most common age for users were those born in the 1980s
